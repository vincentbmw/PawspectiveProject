##  Inspiration

The idea for **Pawspective** was born from a deeply personal and widespread problem in the pet adoption community. Every year, millions of dogs end up in shelters, and sadly, many are surrendered not because their owners don't love them, but because there was a mismatch between the dog's needs and the owner's lifestyle.

**The Problem We Observed:**
-  **Wrong Living Situations**: Large, energetic breeds in small apartments
-  **Lifestyle Mismatches**: High-maintenance breeds with busy owners
-  **Family Incompatibility**: Dogs not suitable for families with young children
-  **Experience Gaps**: First-time owners choosing challenging breeds

**Our Mission:**
We realized that with the power of AI and thoughtful questioning, we could help potential dog owners make informed decisions **before** they adopt, reducing the heartbreak of rehoming and creating happier relationships between humans and their canine companions.

**The Emotional Drive:**
Every team member had either experienced or witnessed the joy of a perfect human-dog match, as well as the sadness of incompatible pairings. We wanted to use technology to increase the chances of creating those magical, lifelong bonds.
